# Medical Acronym Expansion Project

## Overview
This project focuses on Medical Acronym Expansion, a specialized task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Medical texts often contain numerous acronyms that can have multiple meanings depending on the context. Accurately interpreting these acronyms is critical for improving understanding, decision-making, and patient care in the healthcare domain. The project aims to leverage advanced NLP techniques to resolve this ambiguity effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Context-Aware Expansion**: Accurately expand medical acronyms based on surrounding text, enabling clear and precise interpretation.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular components for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, allowing flexibility for various datasets and use cases.
- **Extensible Models**: Support for traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forests and SVMs, as well as advanced deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM and Transformers like BERT.
- **Domain-Specific Adaptation**: Incorporates medical-specific embeddings and ontologies to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust model performance.

### Applications:
- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Automate the expansion of acronyms in patient records to improve readability for medical professionals.
- **Medical Research**: Assist researchers by disambiguating acronyms in research papers and clinical studies.
- **Healthcare AI Systems**: Enhance AI-driven systems for medical diagnostics and decision support by providing accurate acronym interpretations.
