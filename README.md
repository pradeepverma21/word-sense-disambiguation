# Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) Project

## Overview
This project focuses on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of WSD is to determine the correct meaning of an acronym based on its context, addressing the problem of lexical ambiguity in human language. 

### Key Features:
- **Context-Aware Disambiguation**: Accurately identify the sense of a word based on surrounding words.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular components for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- **Extensible Models**: Integrate traditional machine learning models or advanced transformers.
